# Tuenti Challenge 6

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

My solutions for the programming contest, using 100% JavaScript (**es2015**)*.

I finished **#172** out of +1.800 [contestants](https://contest.tuenti.net/Stats)... not bad but next year I promise more! ;)

* The original solutions to the challenges were written in JavaScript, though rewritten later in Python for learning purposes (BTW: special thanks to @yajo for his practical advice and patience).
